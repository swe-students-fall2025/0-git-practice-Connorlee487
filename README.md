# Summary: What is Software Engineering?

## Article Summary

This comprehensive article by [Krissy Davis](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/en/magazine/289/what-is-software-engineering) provides an in-depth exploration of software engineering, defining it as "the organised process of creating, designing, and maintaining software" through the application of scientific and practical knowledge. The article covers three main categories of software engineering: operational (maintaining and managing systems), transitional (migrating between software states), and maintenance (ongoing support and optimization). It distinguishes between software engineers and developers, explaining that engineers typically work on larger, complex projects with a broader scope encompassing the entire software development lifecycle, while developers may focus more on specific coding tasks. The article emphasizes software engineering's importance through five key benefits: simplifying complex processes, reducing expenses and development time, enabling efficient management of large projects, and creating reliable software systems.

## What's Most Interesting

**The Holistic Nature of Software Engineering**: What's particularly fascinating about this article is how it reveals software engineering as far more than just coding—it's presented as a comprehensive discipline that encompasses everything from budget planning and stakeholder collaboration to architectural design and quality assurance. The article effectively demonstrates that software engineering is essentially the "foundation that empowers us to create and shape the incredible technological advancements that shape our world," positioning it as a strategic, systems-thinking approach rather than just technical implementation.

**The Practical Impact on Business Operations**: The article's focus on the tangible business benefits of software engineering is compelling, particularly how it reduces costs and development time through systematic approaches. The emphasis on managing "massive projects" efficiently and creating "reliable software" that consistently performs without errors highlights how software engineering directly translates to business value. This practical perspective makes the field accessible and shows why organizations invest heavily in proper software engineering practices—it's not just about building cool technology, but about creating sustainable, scalable solutions that drive real-world impact.

It was nice of the article to include the differences between a Software Developer and a Software Engineer as I was not that aware of the differences between the two roles. I did not realize that software developers focused more on debugging.
